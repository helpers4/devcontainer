**Key benefits:**
- Automatic fixup commits for staged changes
- Multi-architecture support (x86_64, aarch64)
- Git subcommand integration
- Lightweight single binary installation
- Perfect for cleaning up commit history

[📖 Documentation](./src/git-absorb/README.md)

### local-mounts

Mounts local Git, SSH, GPG, and npm configuration files into the devcontainer for seamless development authentication.

**Key benefits:**
- Git configuration available inside container
- SSH keys for Git operations and remote connections
- GPG keys for commit signing
- npm authentication for private registries

## Acknowledgments

Inspired by the [DevContainers Features](https://github.com/devcontainers/features) repository and [stuart leeks' dev-container-features](https://github.com/stuartleeks/dev-container-features) for the shell-history concept, with the key difference being project-scoped rather than global user history persistence.
